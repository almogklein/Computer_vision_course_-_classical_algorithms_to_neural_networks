In Lecture 2, we will cover three fundamental topics in image processing: Histogram Equalization, Convolutions, and Denoising. 

These are essential techniques that every image processing practitioner must master.

In the first part of the lecture, we will dive into Histogram Equalization, a technique used to enhance the contrast of an image. 

We will learn about the theory behind it and how it works, including its applications and limitations.


Next, we will move on to Convolutions, a core operation in image processing. 

We will cover the basics of how convolutions work and their importance in image processing. 

We will also explore different types of convolutions, including edge detection and smoothing.


Lastly, we will discuss Denoising, the process of removing noise from an image. 

We will explore different techniques for denoising, including Median filtering and Gaussian filtering.

For the homework assignment, you will apply these concepts to practice by implementing Histogram Equalization, Convolutions, and Denoising techniques on various images. 

You will also be asked to experiment with different parameter settings to evaluate their impact on image quality. 

This assignment will give you hands-on experience with these fundamental image processing techniques, setting the foundation for the rest of the course.
