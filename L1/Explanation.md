Welcome to the first homework assignment for the Classical Image Processing course! In this assignment, we will focus on Sampling and Quantization.


Sampling is the process of converting a continuous signal, such as an image, into a discrete signal that can be processed by a computer. 

In this homework, we will explore how sampling affects the quality of the reconstructed image.


Quantization, on the other hand, is the process of converting the continuous amplitude values of an image into a finite number of discrete levels. 

In this homework, we will investigate how quantization affects the visual quality of the image.

To complete this assignment, you will need to implement various functions in Python to perform sampling and quantization on a given image. You will then need to analyze the results of these operations and compare them with the original image.

The homework assignment will consist of several tasks, including:

- Implementing a function to perform image sampling with different sampling rates and analyzing the reconstructed image quality.

- Implementing a function to perform image quantization with different bit depths and analyzing the visual quality of the quantized image.

- Comparing the results of sampling and quantization on the same image and analyzing the trade-offs between image quality and computational complexity.


hope you find this assignment challenging and informative. Good luck!
