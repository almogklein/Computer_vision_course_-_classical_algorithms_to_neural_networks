# Course: Classical Image Processing #

This is a 10-lesson course taught by PhD Chen Sagiv from SagivTech, which focuses on classical computer vision methods with an emphasis on before the DIP (Digital Image Processing) era. 

This course is designed for students who are interested in learning about image processing techniques that have been used for several decades in the field of computer vision.

# Course Overview #
The course will cover the following topics:

Introduction to Image Processing
Sampling & Quantization
Histogram Equalization, Convolutions, and Denoising

Each lesson will include lectures, practical assignments, and discussions. 
The course will be conducted in English and will be delivered online through Zoom.
